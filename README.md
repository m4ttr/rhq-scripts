rhq-scripts
===========
These scripts are used to setup deployment automation and using RHQ drift detection. The drift definitions are setup and used to an alert that takes a cli action (emailDepoy.js)
The emails alerts generated by RHQ arn't very customizable.  with emailDeploy.js we generate our own.

Usage:
rhq-remoting-cli/bin/rhq-cli.sh -f deployToGroup.js (application.war|application.ear) <groupName>
Extract the Implementation-Version number from META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and deploy the application to <groupName>
The Implemntation-Version number will be deployed into JON and an email notification will be sent on behalf of emailDeploy.js

Usage:
emailDeploy.js
Configured as a CLI Notification for drift defintions setup as deployment notifications.

Usage:
rhq-remoting-cli/bin/rhq-cli.sh -f createAppDriftforDeploy.js <group>
Creats definitions for deployed ear or war files in JBossAS5 JVMs.

Usage:
(Forked from rhq docs)

Usage:
rhq-remoting-cli/bin/rhq-cli.sh -f deleteDrifts.js <searchTerm>
